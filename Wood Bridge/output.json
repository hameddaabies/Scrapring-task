The thought of going at work now will make me late for work for one more trip to this toilet, paper smearing is barbaric to me anymore. The auto open is awesome, the toilet screams \"give me your poo\" when it does this, the cleans you up, and before you have a chance to pull your pants up...whoosh it's already gone. I always liked a cool toilet seat, however the heated seat feels very nice and start automatically. Anyways, I hope this toilet functions for years to come because currently, it is awesome.",

I cannot praise enough about its smart features; it has all the bells and whistles you could ask for in a bidet.\n\nMy favorite feature is the seat warmer, and you can adjust the seat temperature (great for changing seasons). I also enjoy the automatic flush -- it makes me feel clean because I don't have to touch the toilet with my hands at all. \n\nSo far, we have received lots of compliments from guests. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.",

Anyways, I now feel like Randy from South Park when he gets rid of ol' blue and buys a Smart Toilet. If you haven't seen the episode watch it and he will persuade you even more to purchase this Smart Toilet. This one being (Model B0990S) in a steal in terms of the price with as many features as it offers. I bought one for my Master Bathroom and plan to buy another for my 2nd bathroom very soon. It does everything that Randy's from South Park does minus the Japanese music that the Toilet plays when the lid automatically opens in the episode. lol",

If you are installing yourself you will need help lifting it onto the bolts. Also, install the t-adapter onto the back of the toilet along with the bidet seats hose and the line that will go to your water main before lowering the toilet onto the bolts... That being said I love the height of the toilet along with its apperance. As for the bidet seat it is the perfect pair for a perfect toilet",
